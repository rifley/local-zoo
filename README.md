## Planning

1. Integration
  * animal.model.ts for animal object constructor
  * new-animal.component.ts - contains new animal form
  * animal-list.component.ts - shows list of all current animals
  * age.pipe.ts - filters animals based on age
  * edit-animal.component.ts - contains edit form, two way binding

2. UX/UI
  * high contrast between text/background, large font, alt tags for high accessibility to users
  * style fits zoo theme

3. Polish
  * spend more time on UX/UI to ensure readability/accessibility
  * add in further exploration elements
